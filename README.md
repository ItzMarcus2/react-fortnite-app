# react-fortnite-app

I'm creating this app to train my skills in the following: React, Javascript, Node.js and Express.js and PostgreSQL databases

This app will allow me to add a win everytime I win in fortnite so I can go back and see how many kills I got when I won, it will also display player name and the date that the player won.
